Homework #1
9 March 2023

Deadline: 23 March 2023 23:59 (GMT+3)

You are required to submit your homework to WebOnline System.
Put all your source codes, program outputs, reports (only PDF), etc. in a ZIP file.
User your student number and ”-ceng520-hw1” suffix as filename.
e.g. c1234567-ceng520-hw1.zip

1 Create letter frequency table
• Write a program that creates letter frequency table.
• Choose an alphabet and a sample text.
• Example: Start with a sample ”lorem ipsum” text (https://www.lipsum.com/) with English alphabet.
• Manipulate text to contain only small letters: Convert capital letters to small ones and ignore all
other characters.
• The program should take the text as input and return a table that contains the frequencies of each
letter defined in your chosen alphabet.
• Choose a long English text (could be a book chapter, news page, etc.).
• Choose a long Turkish text (optional, for Turkish students only).
• Compare your results with well known language frequency tables
(e.g. https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/letterfrequencies.html).
• Try with different length of texts and observe results.
 	

 
2 Compute the entropy
• Use the program you have developed in first question.
• Write a program that takes the output of the first question (the frequency table of letters) as input
and return the entropy value.
• Compute entropy of each text sample you’ve used in the first question.
• Compress each text and compute entropy of the compressed data (Be careful with the alphabet).
Compare results with previous computations. (You are free to use any compression algorithm.)

3 TCP/IP Stack Error Detection/Correction
Write a literature review about the algorithms and methods used for the error detection and/or correction
in the TCP/IP Stack. Address solutions in each layer.
